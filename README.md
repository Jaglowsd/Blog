# Blog
A blog web application written in jQuery, CSS, HTML, and Bootstrap.

A simple blog designed to allow users to create a blog account, create their own blog, view posts, visit other users blogs, and comment on other user's posts. Some of the functionality is extremeley limited as the server was not designed by me. For example, the user cannot edit their blogs once created. However, as I am familiar with the how the server itself is designed, I would be able to implement such features if I had access to the server as well as the database used. 

The blog has a modern feel, extremely easy to navigate, appleaing to the eye, and has much more potential than what is shown.
